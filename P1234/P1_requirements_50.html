<h2>Administrative Details:</h2>
<p>Client: Barack Obama (44th President of the United States of America)</p>
<p>Our imaginary client, Barack Obama, is the owner of the up-and-coming fast food chain - O’Burger. After 8 long years in the Oval Office, Obama finally decided to follow his long lost childhood dream, and start up his own fast food restaurant which specializes in burgers. O’Burger’s first restaurant opened during the summer of 2019 in his home-city, Honolulu, Hawaii. Since then, Obama has managed to franchise his burger restaurant. Today, O’Burger has restaurants spread all around the world, but no website! Therefore, we decided to fix the problem.</p>

<h2>Purpose and Goals:</h2>
<p>The purpose of the website is to serve as a platform for the fast food chain - O’Burger, which will both inform and intrigue our audience about the products, prices, services and other information through it’s appealing and well-structured design, giving them the best possible browsing experience.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Audience:</h2>
<p>The site is aimed at anyone who loves a good burger, but especially younger people and students. O’Burger offers a wide range of burgers and drinks that anyone loves regardless of their age. It is therefore natural that the audience consists of older people too. The majority of the audience will be younger people and students due to the student discounts and weekly deals that you can find on our site. The website is also for people who want to know more about O’Burger and potential employees or business partners who want to reach out to us.</p>

<p>The domain name of the final website: <a href="http://folk.ntnu.no/torbjss/" target="_blank">http://folk.ntnu.no/torbjss/</a><br>

<h2>Technical difficulties:</h2>
<p>We will be using pictures for our menu and previews, which can cause slower loading times. This is a problem that we want to avoid by keeping the number of images and image-sizes to a minimum. There might also be problems regarding the site navigation. Users might find it hard to navigate the site or not be able to read or understand the navigation bar and its links. The navigation bar should therefore be quite large with a font and font-size that is easy to read. The navigation bar should also make it possible for the users to navigate on the site in as few clicks as possible. We want the user experience on mobile to be as good as on a computer. We will therefore be testing on mobile to make sure that all of our users get the best possible user experience. </p>
