            <h2>Changes Made to HTML Files:</h2>
            <p>We decided to keep our five intended pages. However, we have mostly made minimal changes , these are
                summarized and listed below.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to index.html (Homepage):</strong>
                The slideshow is now updated with fitting deals and discounts. When comparing the intended and the final
                webpage, we have added more visual buttons for “O’Story” and “Find your restaurant”, which will help the
                user navigate to the different pages easier. Finally, we decided to add a darker overlay over both the
                banners of “O’Story” and “Find your restaurant”, considering the intended lighter overlay stood out too
                much.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to about.html:</strong>
                The intended banner has been replaced with a more fitting image with higher quality. The background
                images behind the texts have also been replaced with picture collages, which are located below each
                text, respectively. We added a grey overlay over the collages to make them smoother and fit the general
                color scheme of the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to order.html:</strong>
                We decided to change the images for O’Burger to a Hawaiian Burger, which will correspond with the text
                in the “O’Story”-section. Soft drink was updated to O’Beverage to fit the O’-name theme. Regarding the
                receipt, we decided to add a checkbox, which will give the user a student discount if checked. The
                overall design of the receipt also received some small tweaks, e.g adding the orange lines to separate
                the receipt from the menu items and the input areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to find_restaurant.html:</strong>
                We decided to replace the static image with a live one, using Google Maps API. The overall design on
                this page also received some small changes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Only restaurant names are in bold text.</li>
                <li>Removed the horizontal orange border lines.</li>
                <li>The addresses of each restaurant is now clickable, and will pinpoint location on the map. (see
                    <b>find_restaurant.js</b> in "Changes to intended Javascript files:")</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to contact.html:</strong>
                This page didn't undergo many changes. We added an image of Obama and a "How can we help you"-button,
                which will direct the user down to the FAQ and contact form.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Changes Made to Javascript and CSS:</h2>
            <p>We decided to add three additional scripts, </p>
            <h3>Changes to intended Javascript files:</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to navbar.js:</strong>
                In P2 we wrote that the O’Burger logo would be “slightly” bigger when scrolling to the top of the page.
                In the final website, that is an underestimation. The logo is quite enormous. No more changes have been
                made to the navbar functionality, only style, which will be covered later. </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to slideshow.js:</strong>
                The functionality of the slideshow includes everything specified in P2. We also added some lines in the
                script which make the slideshow stop if the user uses a mobile device (less than 600px, configurable).
                This to reduce power consumption for mobile devices. The left and right buttons are also hidden when
                width is less than 600px, but that is done through @media in index.css. </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to order.js:</strong>
                All functionalities specified in P2 are implemented, as well as some new ones:
                The user now has the ability to use discounts to pay less, e.g. student discount (-25%). The discounts
                are present as checkboxes, and more discounts can easily be added to the page through a single line of
                code.
                We added a form to the page where the user sends in information such as name, email and phone number.
                The form, the submit button, and the receipt are now hidden until the user actually adds items to order.
                When the submit button is clicked, a function inside of another javascript file called
                submitImplementation.js is activated. More on that later.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to contact.js:</strong>
                The functionality of contact.js remains the same as in P2, but instead of creating a separate function
                for the submit button on this page, we did as in order.js, and imported a function from
                submitImplementation.js and used that instead, in order to effectively reuse code. </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to footer.js:</strong>
                The footer functionality remains about the same as in P2. However, a button has been added to the right
                of the logo. The button reads “Leave a review” and when clicked, redirects the user to a google forms
                page where they can leave a review for us to see. </p>
            <h4>Additional JavaScript files:</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Added scroll.js:</strong>

            <h3>Final Work Division</h3>
            <p>During this whole project period, we mostly worked as a unit and booked rooms on different campuses such
                as Kalvskinnet and Moholt. Our working method resulted in us working together on most of the tasks,
                which matched our starting plan (listed in P2). Regarding the set due dates, we worked diligently to
                keep them and did so through our weekly working sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is the final work division we ended up with. As you can see, we stuck mostly to the same work
                division as we had planned. Although each individual page had someone in charge of it, we all cooperated
                and helped each other to make it all work together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding where we obtain our images: Most of them were found through Google search and then edited to
                fit our website design.<br>
