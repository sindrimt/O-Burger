            <h2>Changes Made to HTML Files:</h2>
            <p>We decided to keep our five intended pages. However, we have mostly made minimal changes , these are
                summarized and listed below.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to index.html (Homepage):</strong>
                The slideshow is now updated with fitting deals and discounts. When comparing the intended and the final
                webpage, we have added more visual buttons for “O’Story” and “Find your restaurant”, which will help the
                user navigate to the different pages easier. Finally, we decided to add a darker overlay over both the
                banners of “O’Story” and “Find your restaurant”, considering the intended lighter overlay stood out too
                much. Changed the image of Obama eating an apple to Obama sitting with Anthony Bourdain, which has a
                higher quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to about.html:</strong>
                The intended banner has been replaced with a more fitting image with higher quality. The background
                images behind the texts have also been replaced with picture collages, which are located below the text
                elements, respectively. We added a grey overlay to the images to make them smoother and fit the general
                color scheme of the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to order.html:</strong>
                We decided to change the images for O’Burger to a Hawaiian Burger, which will correspond with the text
                in the “O’Story”-section. Soft drink was updated to O’Beverage to fit the O’-name theme. Regarding the
                receipt, we decided to add a checkbox, which will give the user a student discount if checked.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to find_restaurant.html:</strong>
                We decided to replace the static image with a live one, using Google Maps API. The overall design on
                this page also received some small changes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The addresses of each restaurant is now clickable, and will pinpoint location on the map. (see
                    <b>find_restaurant.js</b> in "Changes to intended Javascript files:")</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to contact.html:</strong>
                This page didn’t undergo many changes. We added an image of Obama and a “How can we help you”-button
                that scrolls down to the FAQ questions when clicked.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Changes Made to Javascript and CSS:</h2>
            <p>We decided to add three additional scripts, </p>
            <h3>Changes to intended Javascript files:</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to navbar.js:</strong>
                In P2 we wrote that the O’Burger logo would be “slightly” bigger when scrolling to the top of the page.
                In the final website, that is an underestimation. The logo is quite enormous. No more changes have been
                made to the navbar functionality, only style, which will be covered later. The navbar is smaller for
                mobile users, and the user has to use two clicks to navigate to any of the pages. This is because the
                user has to click on the navbar to open the drop down menu, and then click on the desired page. </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to slideshow.js:</strong>
                The functionality of the slideshow includes everything specified in P2. We also added some lines in the
                script which make the slideshow stop if the user uses a mobile device (less than 600px, configurable).
                This to reduce power consumption for mobile devices. The left and right buttons are also hidden when
                width is less than 600px, but that is done through a media query in index.css. </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to order.js:</strong>
                All functionalities specified in P2 are implemented, as well as some new ones:
                The user now has the ability to use discounts to pay less, e.g. student discount (-25%). The discounts
                are present as checkboxes, and more discounts can easily be added to the page through a single line of
                code.
                We added a form to the page where the user sends in information such as name, email and phone number. We
                decided not to add the intended labels in the form, but rather use placeholders with their respective
                values.
                The form, the submit button, and the receipt are now hidden until the user actually adds items to order.
                When the submit button is clicked, a function inside of another javascript file called
                submitImplementation.js is activated. More on that later.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to contact.js:</strong>
                The functionality of contact.js remains the same as in P2, but instead of creating a separate function
                for the submit button on this page, we did as in order.js, and imported a function from
                submitImplementation.js and used that instead, in order to effectively reuse code.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Changes to footer.js:</strong>
                The footer functionality remains about the same as in P2. However, a button has been added to the right
                of the logo. The button reads “Leave a review” and when clicked, redirects the user to a google forms
                page where they can leave a review for us to see. </p>
            <h4>Additional JavaScript files:</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Added scroll.js:</strong>
                We came up with a functionality that might look modern and appealing for gen z and millennials.
                Scroll.js lets us easily create images that scroll with a different speed compared to the rest of the
                content, which creates a cool “background” feel to the images. Theoretically, since we use classes to
                identify scroll images, there can exist more than one scroll image on each page, but we only have one
                scroll image for Find Restaurant, O’bout and Contact.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Added submitImplementation.js:</strong>
                This file acts a little different than the others. It does nothing on its own, but rather provides
                useful functions that other javascript pages can use. It is used by contact.js and order.js for, as the
                name might suggest, the submit buttons. submitImplementation.js offers functions that reset all the
                content of the article.content elements on the page (which are present and standardized on almost every
                page), and fills the void with a custom message and a button which can be clicked to reload the current
                page. This javascript file was primarily created to avoid copy-pasting very similar code in the order
                and contact pages, we thought it was better to rather call a single function from this file instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Added find_restaurant.js:</strong>

                This script imports google maps to the website. The Implementation of google maps to a website using
                javascript requires an API key which is obtained by creating a google maps billing account, which we
                did. Google themselves provides a code snippet to be used in javascript, but it is only a couple of
                lines (commented in the script). We coded the rest of the script which adds the feature to
                click a link that centers the maps to a set location. The script is not completely independent just as a
                script. The table, and the links are created in find_restaurant.html and called in the script. The
                html file also contains a script tag which google provided.

            </p>
            <h3>Changes to the intended CSS-styling:</h3>
            <p>
                We decided to make a global.css which applies to all of the pages, and seperate css-files which applies
                to their respective html-files. This way, we can make changes to every page in the global.css and
                overwrite or make separate changes to the html-files in their respective css-files.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>global.css:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Contains the style for our navbar and footer, some buttons, image classes and scroll functions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added media queries to reduce the font size of the navbar when the user zooms out or uses a large
                    monitor. This way, the text in the footer won’t disappear.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Main font: Changed from Signika Negative SC to Signika.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fallback fonts: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif
                </li>
                <li>
                    Links with borders and gray overlays have white fonts, while the links connected to the google API
                    on the ‘find_restaurant.html’ page have an orange font.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The orange font has a lighter hue when the
                    cursor is hovered above the link.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The background image in the footer is a bit more zoomed in. Removed the white line in the footer,
                    and positioned the facebook and instagram logo beside each other and vertically centered.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>about.css</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Made the font-size of the paragraphs and headings bigger.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added a solid color (HEX: #2f2f2f) background behind the paragraphs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>contact.css</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The items in the receipt are written on separate lines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There’s an orange border above and below the receipt.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>index.css:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Changed the pictures in the slide-show.</li>
                <li>Added a gray overlay on the pictures under the slide-show.</li>
                <li>Added text-boxes on top of the images of obama eating an apple, and the map preview.</li>
                <li>Made the overlay on the images darker.</li>
                <li>The buttons on the slideshow are now invisible when it’s a mobile device (reasons behind
                    this was covered in the slideshow.js part).</li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>order.css:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The overall design of the receipt also received some small tweaks, e.g adding the orange lines to
                    separate the receipt from the menu items and the input areas.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>find_restaurant.css:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Decreased the margin between the restaurant table-elements.</li>
                <li>Only the names of the restaurants have a bold font.</li>
                <li>Removed the orange borders above and below the tables.</li>
                <li>The bold font-style is only applied to the restaurant names.</li>
                <li>Removed the horizontal border lines. The color of these links are orange.</li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <h3>Modularity Requirement:</h3>
            <p>We achieved modularity by making the navbar and footer in javascript. This allows us to include them
                on every page. We used a global css-file, but also specific css-files in order to overwrite or
                make specific changes to their respective html-files.
            </p>

            <p>During this whole project period, we mostly worked as a unit and booked rooms on different campuses such
                as Kalvskinnet and Moholt. Our working method resulted in us working together on most of the tasks,
                which matched our starting plan (listed in P2). Regarding the set due dates, we worked diligently to
                keep them and did so through our weekly working sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is the final work division we ended up with. As you can see, we stuck mostly to the same work
                division as we had planned. Although each individual page had someone in charge of it, we all cooperated
                and helped each other to make it all work together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding where we obtain our images: Most of them were found through Google search and then edited to
                fit our website design.<br>
