            <h2>Testing Document:</h2>
            <p>We decided to make a Google Forms document for our website testing, considering we're living amid a
                pandemic, where we want to minimize social contact as much as possible. In short, the questions will ask
                about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Browser and device</li>
                <li>First impressions</li>
                <li>Website navigation</li>
                <li>Visual appeal</li>
                <li>User-friendliness</li>
                <li>Immediate improvements (voluntary to answer)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Link to Google Form: <a href="https://forms.gle/kRMQLxLVEuaQB3zt6">Here</a></p>

            <h2>Testing Audience:</h2>
            <p>As briefly mentioned above, our current situation has made it difficult to perform live testing.
                Therefore, we decided to distribute the link to the website along with link to the Google Form through
                social media posts and direct messages. Naturally, by using this method, some of our friends, family or
                colleagues did become testers - they may or may not have some bias. Despite these problems, we believe
                our
                testers more or less fitted our intended audience.</p>
            <p>The result:</p>

            <h2>Testing Platforms:</h2>
            <p>As mentioned in the "Testing Document"-section, we asked our testers about which browser and device they
                used for testing. As you can see, most of our testers used Google Chrome as browser and a computer/PC as
                a device.</p>
            <p>The result:</p>
            <img src="../P1234/user_responses/Nettleser.png" alt="Browser Piechart" width="600">
            <img src="../P1234/user_responses/Enhet.png" alt="Device Piechart" width="600"><br><br>

            <h2>Feedback Summary:</h2>
            <p>It is worth mentioning that the testers were shown quite a different website than the one we finally
                delivered, because we chose to take in some of the testers' criticism in order to improve our website.
            </p>
            <u>Design:</u>
            <p>In our Google Forms, we asked two direct questions regarding our design - first impression and degree of
                visual appeal.</p>
            <p>As you can see in the bar charts below, most of our testers was satisified with our design.</p>

            <img src="../P1234/user_responses/visually_appealing.PNG" alt="Design Bar Chart" width="600"><br><br>
            <u>Navigation:</u>
            <p>In the bar chart below, it is apparent, that the testers found the website easy to navigate. The
                importance of easy-navigation was always in the back of our minds, when creating the website.</p>
            <img src="../P1234/user_responses/navigation.PNG" alt="Navigation Bar Chart" width="600"><br><br>

            <u>Content:</u>
            <p>Regarding the content of the website: We asked the testers about what they like the most/least about our
                website, and many seemed to enjoy the concept of our website. Our homemade "O'Burger"-logo also received
                alot of positive feedback; the fact that several of the testers noticed and left positive comments on
                it, was a pleasant surprise.</p>
            <u>User-friendliness:</u>
            <p>When asked, "to what degree was the website user friendly?", about 91,3 % of the testers choose high to
                very high (5-7).</p>

            <h2>Response to Feedback:</h2>
            <p>As mentioned in the "Feedback Summary"-section, many of testers decided to answer the questions regarding
                if they had any suggestions for improvement. We found their criticism extremely helpful, and we decided
                to follow through with some of the desired changes.</p>
            <p>Most of them wanted to see an interactive map on the restaurant page. We decided to implement it, but since
                the implementation uses a Google Maps API, this functionality was not a top priority (we wanted to focus on
                other functionalities that we made from scratch). This resulted into find_restaurant.js not being optimally.
            </p>
            <p>A common problem was that on low-width devices, such as phones, the navbar buttons overlapped
                ("restaurants" read "resta"). In order to improve responsive design, we decided to implement a
                dropdown-menu that appears when the device width is small enough. On lower resolutions, the navbar now
                consists of only one button, "menu", which when clicked, displays a dropdown-menu. The dropdown-menu
                contains all the links as navbar would display, including the home page, but displayed as text and not
                as a logo. The user can scroll inside the menu (it doesn't cover the entire page).
