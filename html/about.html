      <p>O’Burger is an American fast casual restaurant chain based in Honolulu. It started out as a small burger
        stand outside of the Ala Moana Center, solely driven by former President Barack Obama. The stand quickly
        gathered traction for its notoriously tasty Hawaiian burgers. However, in the summer of 2019, the stand was
        moved inside of the Ala Moana Center, and transformed into a restaurant. Following this transition, the menu
        expanded vastly – now serving fried chicken, nuggets, and its renowned milkshakes. </p>
      <p>The idea of O’Burger was first conceived back in 2011, during Obama’s first period of presidency. Considering
        he was the President of the United States at the time; he decided to put the idea to the side. After his eight
        years of presidency, Obama could finally focus on his long-lost childhood dream. </p>
      <p>Since its founding, it has opened six restaurants, where five of them are located along the West Coast of
        America. Regarding Americans who live on the East Coast; they have no need to fear. O’Burger has already
        scheduled the opening of four more restaurants, which all are spread along the Atlantic Coast. Everyone should
        be granted the chance to enjoy O'burger, no matter where one may live.</p>
